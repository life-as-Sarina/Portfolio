    <h2>An Ode To Neil Gaiman</h2>
    <p class="author">by Sarina M</p>
    <p class="poem" id="tribute-info">
      <p class="poem">The first time I met you, it was a Good Omen.<br>
Terry introduced you:<br>
One of you was wearing a hat,<br>
The other tried, but it didn't quite work.<br>

He spoke about your parts, and his parts,<br>
And it seems some parts wrote themselves.</p>

<p class="poem">You grabbed a hold on my soul,<br>
With the help of American Gods.<br>
The whole puzzle came together for me,<br>
and I realized what I always knew -<br>
The best part is that you knew it too.</p>

<p class="poem">For the first time I wasn't alone,<br>
You wrote - and by writing, rewrote.<br>
Taking me back to childhood, or what it should have been.<br>
The Graveyard Book, Stardust, Neverwhere -<br>
all the things I knew and forgot.<br>
You reminded me,
slowly waking me from my supressed, society-inflicted dream.</p>

<p class="poem">And when I broke free,
Sandman.<br>
I could finally breathe, as me.<br>
I could once again see the darkness in all it's glory.<br>
All the realms, the worlds, <br>
The secret knowledge between you and me.</p>

<p class="poem">I still read American Gods every year,<br>
I'm teaching my children now,<br>
about Gods being whatever you sacrifice and pray to,<br>
about worlds within worlds,<br>
and about the Sandman that weaves their dreams.</p>

<p class="poem">I wear black now as an ode to you,<br>
and to Terry.<br>
I wear midnight proudly,<br>
I smile knowingly 
at talk about God (I ask which God)<br>
and when I see bird people in the park,<br>
and when I see the faces of Morpheus in my dreams.</p>

<p class="poem">You have made the human experience meaningful to me.<br>
And for that, for giving me hope when there was none,<br>
I dedicate this Ode to you,<br>
It's not a spear in a raging battle,<br>
yet,<br>
it's one life, that became five lives,<br>
and I owe it all to you.</p>
