The first time I met you, it was a Good Omen.
Terry introduced you:
One of you was wearing a hat,
The other tried, but it didn't quite work.

He spoke about your parts, and his parts,
And it seems some parts wrote themselves.

You grabbed a hold on my soul,
With the help of American Gods.
The whole puzzle came together for me,
and I realized what I always knew -
The best part is that you knew it too.

For the first time I wasn't alone,
You wrote and by writing rewrote.
Taking me back to childhood, or what it should have been.
The Graveyard Book, Stardust, Neverwhere -
all the things I knew and forgot.
You reminded me,
slowly waking me from my supressed, society-inflicted dream.

And when I broke free,
Sandman.
I could finally breathe, as me.
I could once again see the darkness in all it's glory.
All the realms, the worlds, 
The secret knowledge between you and me.

I still read American Gods every year,
I'm teaching my children now,
about Gods being whatever you sacrifice and pray to,
about worlds within worlds,
and about the Sandman that weaves their dreams.

I wear black now as an ode to you,
and to Terry.
I wear midnight proudly,
I smile knowingly 
at talk about God (I ask which God)
and when I see bird people in the park,
and when I see the faces of Morpheus in my dreams.

You have made the human experience meaningful to me.
And for that, for giving me hope when there was none,
I dedicate this Ode to you,
It's not a spear in a raging battle,
yet,
it's one life, that became five lives,
and I owe it all to you.
